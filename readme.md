this file should be updated with every commit
the goal is to slowly and clearly build a recipe web app that at the moment still has to be envisioned but ultimately im not allowed to over engineer it

TO RUN
in recipeapp/api
node server.js
in recipeapp/client/my-app
npm start
this will initialise both the front end and the back end.
the api server.js will run on localhost:5000
the client side will run on localhost:3000
